# automation-lab

Three small projects that solve real problems (alarm escalation logic, date math utilities, and a log parser).
Each project includes a short spec, a working implementation (when applicable), and example inputs/outputs.

## Projects
- [Alarm Escalation](projects/alarm_escalation/README.md)
- [Date Math](projects/date_math/README.md)
- [Log Parser](projects/log_parser/README.md)

## Why this repo exists
I want clear, reviewable proof of practical automation/problem-solving work: define a problem, document constraints, implement or specify, and show examples.
